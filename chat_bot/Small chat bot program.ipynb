It shares a maritime border with the Maldives in the southwest and India in the northwest.\n",

The Sinhalese people form the majority of the population, followed by the Sri Lankan Tamils, who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups have played an influential role in the island's history. Other long-established groups include the Moors, Indian Tamils, Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and Vedda.[13]\n",

      "Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements dating back 125,000 years.[14] The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the PƒÅli canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE.[15][16] Also called the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, or the Granary of the East, Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road.[17][18][19] Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both East Asians and Europeans as long ago as the Anuradhapura period. During a period of great political crisis in the Kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka and sought to control its maritime trade, with a part of Sri Lanka subsequently becoming a Portuguese possession. After the Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch Empire and the Kingdom of Kandy took control of those areas. The Dutch possessions were then taken by the British, who later extended their control over the whole island, colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the early 20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a dominion. It was succeeded by the republic of Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in 1983 and ended in 2009, when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.[20]\n",

It is the highest-ranked South Asian nation in terms of development and has the second-highest per capita income in South Asia. However, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in the collapse of its currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of essentials. It has also led to an eruption of street protests, with citizens successfully demanding that the president and the government step down.[21] The country has had a long history of engagement with modern international groups; it is a founding member of the SAARC, the G77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations.\n",

The Tamil term Eelam (Tamil: ‡Æà‡Æ¥‡ÆÆ‡Øç, romanized: ƒ´·∏ªam) was used to designate the whole island in Sangam literature.[24][25] The island was known under Chola rule as Mummudi Cholamandalam (\"realm of the three crowned Cholas\").[26]\n",

The Persians and Arabs referred to it as Sarandƒ´b (the origin of the word \"serendipity\") from Sanskrit Si·πÉhaladvƒ´pa·∏•.[28][29] Ceil√£o, the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese when they arrived in 1505,[30] was transliterated into English as Ceylon.[31] As a British crown colony, the island was known as Ceylon; it achieved independence as the Dominion of Ceylon in 1948.\n",

In 1972, its formal name was changed to \"Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka\". Later, on 7 September 1978, it was changed to the \"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\".[32][33] As the name Ceylon still appears in the names of a number of organisations, the Sri Lankan government announced in 2011 a plan to rename all those over which it has authority.[34]\n",

In 250 BCE,[53] Mahinda, a bhikkhu and the son of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka arrived in Mihintale carrying the message of Buddhism.[54] His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the Sinhalese population.[55]\n",

It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in Sri Lanka's many monasteries and that the written form of the Tripi·π≠aka, including Sinhalese Buddhist literature, were part of the University of Nalanda.[56] In 245 BCE, bhikkhuni Sanghamitta arrived with the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical Bodhi Tree under which Gautama Buddha became enlightened.[57] It is considered the oldest human-planted tree (with a continuous historical record) in the world.

Dutugamunu, the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king, Kavan Tissa, defeated Elara in the Battle of Vijithapura. During its two and a half millennia of existence, the Sinhala Kingdom was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Indian dynasties such as the Chola, Pandya, and Pallava.[citation needed] There also were incursions by the kingdoms of Kalinga (modern Odisha) and from the Malay Peninsula as well.[citation needed]\n",

Because the PƒÅli Canon was at that time oral literature maintained in several recensions by dhammabhƒÅ·πáakas (dharma reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.

Unlike previous invaders, he looted, ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms beyond recovery.[75] His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of Rajarata as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native Sinhalese people to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.[76][77]\n",

In 1247, the Malay kingdom of Tambralinga which was a vassal of Sri Vijaya led by their king Chandrabhanu[81] briefly invaded Sri Lanka from Insular Southeast Asia. They were then expelled by the South Indian Pandyan dynasty.[82] However, this temporary invasion reinforced the steady flow of the presence of various Austronesian merchant ethnic groups, from Sumatrans (Indonesia) to Lucoes (Philippines) into Sri Lanka which occurred since 200 BCE.[83] Chinese admiral Zheng He and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle, Sri Lanka in 1409 and got into battle with the local king Vira Alakesvara of Gampola. Zheng He captured King Vira Alakesvara and later released him.[84][85][86][87] Zheng He erected the Galle Trilingual Inscription, a stone tablet at Galle written in three languages (Chinese, Tamil, and Persian), to commemorate his visit.[88][89] The stele was discovered by S.

Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities,[229] but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils.[230][231] Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the North-East Province.[232][233] Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks for the provinces were handled by a district-based civil service which had been in place since colonial times.

Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 2nd century BCE by Mahinda Maurya.[311] A sapling of the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka during the same time. The PƒÅli Canon (Thripitakaya), having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE.[312] Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any predominantly Buddhist nation.[311] During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Thailand and Burma.[312]\n",

However, it was activity from across the Palk Strait that truly set the scene for Hinduism's survival in Sri Lanka. Shaivism (devotional worship of Lord Shiva) was the dominant branch practised by the Tamil peoples, thus most of the traditional Hindu temple architecture and philosophy of Sri Lanka drew heavily from this particular strand of Hinduism.

      "There are three main styles of Sri Lankan classical dance. They are, the Kandyan dances, low country dances and Sabaragamuwa dances. Of these, the Kandyan style is most prominent. It is a sophisticated form of dance[373] that consists of five sub-categories: Ves dance, Naiyandi dance, Udekki dance, Pantheru dance and 18 Vannam.[374] An elaborate headdress is worn by the male dancers, and a drum called Geta B√©raya is used to assist the dancers to keep on rhythm.[375]\n",

      "Theatre came to the country when a Parsi theatre company from Mumbai introduced Nurti, a blend of European and Indian theatrical conventions to the Colombo audience in the 19th century.[374] The golden age of Sri Lankan drama and theatre began with the staging of Maname, a play written by Ediriweera Sarachchandra in 1956.[377] It was followed by a series of popular dramas like SinhabƒÅhu, PabƒÅvatƒ´, MahƒÅsƒÅra, Muudu Puththu and Subha saha Yasa.\n",

      "Sri Lankan literature spans at least two millennia and is heir to the Aryan literary tradition as embodied in the hymns of the Rigveda.[378] The PƒÅli Canon, the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, was written down in Sri Lanka during the Fourth Buddhist council, at the Alulena cave temple, Kegalle, as early as 29 BCE.[379] Chronicles such as the MahƒÅva·πÉsa, written in the 6th century, provide vivid descriptions of Sri Lankan dynasties. According to the German philosopher Wilhelm Geiger, the chronicles are based on Sinhala Atthakatha (commentary).[378] The oldest surviving prose work is the Dhampiya-Atuva-Getapadaya, compiled in the 9th century CE.[378] The greatest literary feats of medieval Sri Lanka include Sandesha KƒÅvya (poetic messages) such as GirƒÅ Sandeshaya (parrot message), Hansa Sandeshaya (swan message) and Salalihini Sandeshaya (myna message). Poetry including Kavsilumina, Kavya-Sekharaya (Diadem of Poetry) and proses such as Saddharma-RatnƒÅvaliya, AmƒÅvatura (Flood of Nectar) and PujƒÅvaliya are also notable works of this period, which is considered to be the golden age of Sri Lankan literature.[378] The first modern-day novel, Meena by Simon de Silva appeared in 1905[374] and was followed by several revolutionary literary works. Martin Wickramasinghe, the author of Madol Doova is considered the iconic figure of Sri Lankan literature.[380]\n",

In addition, Sri Lanka became the runners-up of the Cricket World Cup in 2007[387] and 2011,[388] and of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2009 and 2012.[389] Former Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has been rated as the greatest test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack,[390] and four Sri Lankan cricketers ranked 2nd (Sangakkara), 4th (Jayasuriya), 5th (Jayawardene) and 11th (Dilshan) highest ODI run scorers of all time, which is the second best by a team. As of June 2022, Muttiah Muralitharan has the highest aggregate wickets in Test Cricket with a record 800 wickets, a feat he achieved in a Test Match against India in July 2010 that Sri Lanka had won by 10 Wickets.[391][392] Sri Lanka has won the Asia Cup in 1986,[393] 1997,[394] 2004,[395] 2008,[396] 2014.[397] and 2022.[398] Sri Lanka once held the highest team score in all three formats of cricket.[399] The country co-hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1996 and 2011 and hosted the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\n",
